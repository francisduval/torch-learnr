## What is torch?

**Torch** is an R package with 
2 core features:

- Array computation with strong 
GPU accelation

- Deep neural networks built on a 
tape-based autograd system

### Why torch?

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6">

- Torch is based on PyTorch, a framework which's rapidly increasing popularity among deep learning researchers.

- We believe others can use torch's GPU acceleration to implement fast machine learning algorithms using it's convenient interface.

- Torch is flexible and has a low level API making it useful for a vast range of use cases, not only for deep learning.

## How it's implemented?

Before going into code it's nice to understand the basic of how torch is implemented in R.

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6">

- Almost all `torch_*` functions are autogenerated from LibTorch's declaration file. This means that all low level operations are automatically available in the R package.

- Most Neural network modules, optimizers and datasets and dataloaders code is writen in R. It's easy to inspect the code and use it to write your own customizations.

- The diagram shows LibTorch in the bottom and all the layers implemented to allow using torch from R.

- Differently from TensorFlow for R that is built on top of the Python implementation via reticulate, torch is built on top of LibTorch, the C++ API of PyTorch and thus, `torch` has no Python dependency.
